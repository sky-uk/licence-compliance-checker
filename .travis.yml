# This applies to `push` types only, not pull request
# Travis will trigger `push` builds on master or tag to avoid building branches twice for pull requests - see https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests/#double-builds-on-pull-requests
# The tag to build should follow semantic versioning
branches:
  only:
    - master
    - /^v([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+).*$/
